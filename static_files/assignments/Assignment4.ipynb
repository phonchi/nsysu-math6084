    "in the performance of KNN and other local approaches that perform prediction using only observations that are near the test observation for which a prediction must be made. This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality, and it ties into the fact that parametric approaches often perform poorly when $p$ is large. We will now investigate this curse."
